            <p>The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps their eyes
            on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where
            typists rest their wrist down, rather than lifting up and typing (which can cause carpal tunnel
            syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place
            their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep
            their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers
            should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.
